# How to play

- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- You are X, your opponent (computer) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over and ends in a draw if no player has 3 marks in a row.

# AI difficulty levels:

Use the toggle button to switch between difficulty levels:
- Easy: The AI makes random moves.
- Hard: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
